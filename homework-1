## Threat Modelling
The Threat Modeling Manifesto outlines a structured and principled approach to threat modeling, emphasizing the importance of building secure systems by addressing potential risks early and effectively. 
It advocates for a proactive culture where security considerations are integrated into the design and planning phases, rather than being treated as an afterthought. 
The manifesto highlights the value of people and collaboration, emphasizing that diverse stakeholders and teamwork are more critical than relying solely on tools and processes. 
It encourages critical thinking and flexibility by promoting the use of tailored questions to uncover threats, rather than adhering strictly to generic checklists.

The manifesto identifies threat modeling as an iterative process that evolves alongside the system. 
Perfection is not the goal in the initial stages; instead, continuous refinement ensures the model remains relevant and effective. 
A strong emphasis is placed on actionable outcomesâ€”doing the work of threat modeling, rather than merely discussing its theoretical aspects.
