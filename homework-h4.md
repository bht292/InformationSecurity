## Broken Access Control
Broken Access Control is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application improperly enforces restrictions on user actions. It results to allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or functions.
Hackers can take advantage of this to see, change or delete data. Furthermore, they can even act as admins without permission sometimes. 

### Vulnerabilites

### Prevention

To stop it, apps should block access by default and make sure permissions are checked properly.
